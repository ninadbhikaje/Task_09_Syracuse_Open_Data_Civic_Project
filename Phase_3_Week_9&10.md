# Phase 3 – Testing, Validation & Feature Completion (Weeks 9-10)

Weeks 9–10 completed Phase 3 by hardening the SPD Personnel Complaints analysis pipeline, expanding quality assurance, and declaring the dashboard feature-complete. Week 9 focused on reliability and validation: unit tests were extended to cover critical transformations (timezone-aware datetime parsing, handling of `"Open"` closure values, allegation-type normalization, resolution time calculations, and all aggregations feeding the seven charts), while integration tests verified end-to-end runs from raw CSV ingestion to processed outputs. Automated validation summaries now execute after cleaning, reporting row counts before/after filters, missingness in key fields (especially outcomes), and anomalies such as future complaint dates or negative resolution days. Edge-case handling was added for empty or single-row datasets, all-missing outcome columns, malformed text fields, and filter combinations that yield no results in the dashboard, with clear user-facing warnings rather than silent failures.

Week 10 finalized the feature set: the reproducible pipeline cleanly separates acquisition, transformation, analysis, and presentation; all seven production visualizations are wired into the Plotly Dash dashboard with stable filters, tooltips, and export options; and documentation is brought to submission quality, including an updated README, data dictionary, function-level API notes for `src/`, and a brief dashboard usage guide. Version control shows a meaningful commit history for feature additions, refactors, and bug fixes, and test coverage across core modules now exceeds the project’s expectations. The result is a feature-complete, well-tested, and fully documented Phase 3 artifact that is ready for Phase 4 deployment, monitoring, and advanced analytics work.
