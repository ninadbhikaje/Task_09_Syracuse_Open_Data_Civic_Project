# Phase 4 – Week 11: Polish & Documentation (Part 1)

**Project:** SPD Personnel Complaints Analysis Pipeline  
**Phase:** Week 11 of 12 — Polish and Documentation (Part 1)

Week 11 focused on the first half of the Phase 4 goals: tightening the behavior of the existing pipeline and dashboard, and laying the groundwork for full documentation. On the engineering side, I fixed bugs and edge cases uncovered during Phase 3, including more robust handling of missing or mis-typed columns, malformed dates, “Open” closure values, empty filter results, and very small datasets, while also adding clearer error messages so failures are explainable instead of silent. I did a light performance pass to confirm that the current Pandas-based aggregations and Plotly Dash callbacks remain responsive at the expected data size, addressing any obvious inefficiencies without changing the overall architecture. On the UX side, I refined visual design details such as consistent titles, labels, and help text across all seven charts, clarified in-dashboard warnings about data limitations (missing outcomes and recency bias in open cases), and improved default filter states so first-time users see a meaningful overview immediately.  

In parallel, I began the documentation push that will be completed in Week 12. For the **README**, I drafted the structure and initial text for the project description, motivation, high-level feature list, and quickstart (installation and basic usage), reserving sections for screenshots, data source links, and known limitations to be polished later. For **TECHNICAL.md**, I outlined the architecture overview (pipeline stages and dashboard layer), code organization by directory (`data/`, `src/`, `dashboard/`, `tests/`, `docs/`), and development setup, and captured notes for testing and deployment instructions to expand next week. For **METHODOLOGY.md**, I sketched the narrative describing the main data processing steps (date parsing, status flags, category normalization, resolution time calculation) and the analytical focus of each of the seven visualizations, leaving detailed discussion of LLM usage, validation procedures, and statistical caveats to be written in Week 12. Together, these Week 11 changes move the project from “feature complete” to “polished and explainable,” setting up Week 12 to finalize all documentation into submission-ready form.
