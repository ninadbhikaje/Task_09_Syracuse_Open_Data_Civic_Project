# Task_09_Syracuse_Open_Data_Civic_Project

## Phase 1 – Project Framing & Data Selection

During Phase 1, the project focused on defining a clear civic-technology question grounded in real-world accountability: what publicly reported SPD personnel complaints can reveal about patterns in misconduct allegations and how they are handled administratively over time.[conversation_history:0] The work began by surveying the City of Syracuse open data portal and selecting the SPD Personnel Complaints dataset as a suitable source because it is structured, machine-readable, and directly connected to public oversight concerns.[conversation_history:0] A key emphasis in this phase was clarifying that complaint records capture **reported** behavior and internal classifications rather than the full universe of incidents, which affects how trends and rates should be interpreted and communicated.[conversation_history:0] Phase 1 also documented initial ethical and bias risks, including underreporting, unequal access to complaint mechanisms, and the limits of drawing strong conclusions without demographic or geographic fields.[conversation_history:0] Finally, this phase established reproducible workflow conventions—such as a raw/processed data directory structure, notebook-based analysis, and a clear separation between data transformation, visualization, and narrative explanation—to support transparency, auditability, and future extensibility of the project.[conversation_history:0]

## Phase 2 – Exploration & Visual Analytics

Phase 2 translated the conceptual framing into hands-on exploratory data analysis using the SPD Personnel Complaints (2021–Present) CSV in a Jupyter notebook environment.[conversation_history:0] The work started with careful data validation: refining a column-by-column data dictionary, parsing complaint and closure dates, normalizing categorical fields (for example allegation types and intake sources), and quantifying substantial missingness in outcome-related columns and disciplinary fields.[conversation_history:0] Building on this foundation, Phase 2 implemented seven core visualizations—complaints per year, complaints by allegation type, allegation outcomes by year, open vs. closed complaints by quarter, a resolution-time histogram for closed cases, resolution time by allegation type using boxplots, and complaints by intake source—to construct a multi-angle view of complaint volume, allegation content, timelines, and administrative flow.[conversation_history:0] Each visualization was paired with interpretation text that foregrounded uncertainty, especially the impact of partial temporal coverage, missing outcomes, and the large share of open cases on any conclusions about accountability or discipline.[conversation_history:0] Phase 2 also used these visuals to generate and document concrete, testable hypotheses (such as force-related allegations taking longer to resolve or intake channel being associated with different closure patterns), positioning them as inputs for more rigorous modeling, dashboard design, and stakeholder-facing storytelling in later phases of the project.[conversation_history:0]
