# Task_09_Syracuse_Open_Data_Civic_Project

Phase 1 – Project Framing & Data Selection
During Phase 1, the project focused on defining a clear civic-technology question grounded in real-world accountability: what can publicly reported SPD personnel complaints reveal about patterns in misconduct allegations and how they are handled administratively over time. The work began by surveying the City of Syracuse open data portal, selecting the SPD Personnel Complaints dataset as a suitable source because it is structured, regularly updated, and directly connected to public oversight concerns. A key part of this phase was articulating why complaint data reflects reported behavior and administrative processes rather than the full universe of incidents, and why that distinction matters for interpretation and communication. Phase 1 also documented initial ethical and bias risks, including underreporting, differential access to complaint mechanisms, and the limits of drawing conclusions without demographic or geographic fields. Finally, this phase established the project’s reproducible workflow conventions—such as a raw/processed data directory structure, notebook-based analysis, and clear separation between data transformation, visualization, and narrative explanation—to set up later phases for transparency and auditability.

Phase 2 – Exploration & Visual Analytics
Phase 2 translated the conceptual framing into hands-on exploratory data analysis using the SPD Personnel Complaints (2021–Present) CSV in a Jupyter notebook environment. The work began with careful data validation: refining a column-by-column data dictionary, parsing complaint and closure dates, normalizing categorical fields (such as allegation types and intake sources), and quantifying substantial missingness in outcome-related columns. With this foundation, Phase 2 implemented seven core visualizations—complaints per year, complaints by allegation type, allegation outcomes by year, open vs. closed complaints by quarter, a resolution-time histogram for closed cases, resolution time by allegation type via boxplots, and complaints by intake source—to build an initial, multi-angle view of complaint volume, content, timelines, and administrative flow. Each chart was paired with concise but critical interpretation text, emphasizing how temporal coverage, missing outcomes, and a high proportion of open cases constrain what can responsibly be inferred from the patterns. Phase 2 also used these visuals to generate and document testable hypotheses (for example, that force-related allegations take longer to resolve or that intake channel might relate to closure patterns), explicitly positioning them as leads for more rigorous modeling, dashboard design, and stakeholder-facing storytelling in subsequent phases.
